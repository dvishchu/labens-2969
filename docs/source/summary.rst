Summary
=======

After completion of this lab, you should get experience with automation of EVPN configuration via Ansible on the IOS-XE platform. As part of the lab, we gradually provisioned configuration of underlay and overlay configuration including configuration of the access interfaces for the end hosts connected to fabric. We also covered use case where we need to incrementally add or remove services from EVPN fabric without disruption of existing services. 

Please, note that this lab was build based on the `cat9k-evpn-ansible <https://github.com/Cat9kEVPN/cat9k-evpn-ansible>`_ repository stored on the Github. This lab presented dedicated portion of functionality and for more advanced uses cases, please follow our repository documentation. 

We hope that you will find content of this lab useful and that you will be able to use gained experience in your daily job.
